# react0toadv
This repository contains my complete learning journey of React.js — from fundamentals to advanced concepts — structured as a hands-on course. It covers everything from JSX, components, hooks, and props to advanced topics like performance optimization, routing, context API, custom hooks, state management, testing, and more.

## Example Projects

To enhance your learning, check out the [examples](./examples) folder. Each major topic includes a mini-project demonstrating key concepts and best practices.

- [JSX Example](./examples/jsx) — Learn how JSX works in React.

More examples will be added for other topics like components, hooks, and more.
