# JSX Example

This mini-project demonstrates the basics of JSX in React.

## Concepts Covered
- Embedding expressions in JSX
- Using JSX to render elements
- Best practices for JSX syntax

## How to Run
1. Open `App.js` in this folder.
2. Copy the code into a new React project or use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) for quick testing.

## Explanation
JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly in your JavaScript code. It makes it easier to visualize the UI structure and embed dynamic expressions.

See `App.js` for a simple example.
